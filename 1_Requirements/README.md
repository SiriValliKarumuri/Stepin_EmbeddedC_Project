## Introduction
 The seat heater heats up fast and stays warm, combating fatigue and relaxing you.The seat optimizes the place and temperature control 
 according to the time after the heater activates.It reduces the time it takes until you feel warm and maintains comforting warmth for 
 longer.As blood circulation improves, fatigue when driving is minimized, relaxing drivers in the car.Seat Heater is powered by a heating 
 element, a long strip of material that functions as a resistor.A resistor resists the flow of electricity. When electric current flows
 through it,the energy is turned into heat, which flows through the seat, warming the rider.


## SEAT HEATING APPLICATION

--> This project name is Seat Heating Application.

--> In this project we are designing a car seat heater using a microcontroller.

--> For that we are doing 3 activities.

## ACTIVITY-1:

---> In Activity-1 we are connecting 2 buttons for atmega328.

---> In that 2 buttons 1 is button sensor is used to say whether the passenger is seated or not.

---> Led Actuator shows the driver is seated. 

---> Another one is heater button which is used to detect the heat. 

---> Heater will check the heater button is ON. 

## ACTIVITY-2:

---> In Activity-2 we get the detected temperature. 

---> we can increase or decrease the temperature by using switch or a button. -

---> we can set it to either minimum or maximum values. 

---> example: In the range of (20%-33%)

## ACTIVITY-3:

---> In Activity-3 it displays the value of temperature as output.

---> Display CDD-CRO will give the temperature value by showing PWM .

## ACTIVITY-4:

---> In Activity-4 it displays the value of temperature using USART.
 
## Features

- Depends on User that what which microcontoller is used.

- Customer can change the temperature as per his requirement.

- Display the Temperature.

- EmbeddedC Based Programming.

## SWOT- Strengths, and Weakness, Opportunities Threats

### Strengths

- Improves Health(Blood Pressure).

- According to season the requirement changes.

### Weakness

- Can't be used in every vechicle.

### Opportunities

- Can implement in different vehicles using different microcontrollers.

- Can make the Application using other programming languages.

### Threats

- Can check the temperature maintainted properly.

## 4W's and 1'H
