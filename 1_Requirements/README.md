## Introduction

    The seat heater heats up fast and stays warm, combating fatigue and relaxing you.The seat optimizes the place and temperature control according to the time after the heater activates. It reduces the time it takes until you feel warm and maintains comforting warmth for longer. As blood circulation improves, fatigue when driving is minimized, relaxing drivers in the car. Seat Heater is powered by a heating element, a long strip of material that functions as a resistor. A resistor resists the flow of electricity. When electric current flows through it, the energy is turned into heat, which flows through the seat, warming the rider.

## Features

- Depends on User that what which microcontoller is used.
- Customer can change the temperature as per his requirement.
- Display the Temperature.
- EmbeddedC Based Programming.
