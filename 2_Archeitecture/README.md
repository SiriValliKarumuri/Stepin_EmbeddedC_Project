## BLOCK DIAGRAM:

 * ATmega328P is one of the high performances AVR technology microcontroller with a large number of pins and features. 
 * It is designed by 8-bit CMOS technology and RSIC CPU which enhance its performance and its power efficiency get improved by auto sleeps and internal temperature sensor. 
 * This ATmega328P IC comes with internal protections and multiple programming methods which helps the engineers to priorities this controller for different situations. 
 * The IC allows multiple modern era communications methods for other modules and microcontrollers itself, which is why the microcontroller ATmega328P usage
   has been increasing every day.
